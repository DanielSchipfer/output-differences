# output-differences

**Instructions**
1. You need to input the same inputs as in the "Execution Example" (your a1 programm needs to run until your last input without crashing).
2. You need to install the libraries "difflib" and "colorama" (you can type "pip install difflib colorma" into your terminal without the quotation marks and press enter).
3. Copy and paste your entire output between the quotation marks in the variable "my_string".
4. Run the script and you'll get the differences shown in the terminal - it will compare your output to the "Execution Example" and show you the differences (if there are any). There might be some false positives in the lines you used the .strip() method.
